# Persian character classifier
Python program to classify persian characters, including letters and digits.
* We have used the Lenet architecture to design two models: letter classifier and digit classifier..
* Trained these networks on a self-gathered data set.
* Achieved a test accuracy higher than 90%.
* we have also used OpenCV function to recognize which check box of the input image has been filled.
